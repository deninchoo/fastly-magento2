## 1.2.38

- Fix for Edit Backends where due to improper escaping in certain situations backends would not show

## 1.2.37

- Add ability to see full stack trace of purge all requests. Often times 3rd party modules will invoke purge all
needlessly and this allows you to track down who is making the calls. By default this functionality is off.

- Don't cache /customer/section/load. This works around core bug where Cache-Control headers are set to cache https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/pull/111
- Due to the way Fastly plugin is implemented we are still sending Varnish like purges which don't do anything https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/pull/110. This fixes it so it doesn't send those
